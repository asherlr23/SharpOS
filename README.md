# SharpOS
A console OS made entirely using C#. Made alternating between local VSCode
and code spaces.


# Requirements
- .NET 7.0 Installed
- Code Editor (I Recommend VSCode or Rider)
- A Decent PC (it's a big project)

# Building

## Codespaces (RECOMMENDED)
Just clone the repo, click the "code" button, click codespaces, click the plus, 
and you're done.
### NOTE: 
if you dont have github pro, you have a maximum of 120 hours of usage per month.
Pro users have 180 hours.

## Local
Make sure you have the requirement above.
Download the Repo using the "Code" button. Open it in the editor of your choice.
open the terminal. Type "dotnet run" while in the folder youhave SharpOS in.
